Co-Founded a Python Programming Club with [Ali Baker] to provide a brand new introduction to programming opportunity in our high school community. We used the popular book [Python for Kid: A Playful Introduction To Programming], adapated to python3, to introduce the basic concepts of coding to 6 younger colleagues.

The final project of the club was to create a bouncing head game using Pygame, which consisted of a ball (a studentâ€™s head for fun) bouncing around the screen and was held within the boundaries of the screen using a paddle (the paddle was left up to each person's imagination ðŸ¥•).
