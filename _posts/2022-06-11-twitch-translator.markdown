This is a simple translator bot that I use for [my stream] to communicate with viewers from different backgrounds where English is not their first language.

It is currently being used by 33 streamers (including myself).

The source code is currently private but I am working on making it public.

Technoligies used:

```
Javascript
Google Translate API
```

[my stream]: https://www.twitch.tv/moh__t
