This is a simple translator bot that I use for [my stream] to communicate with viewers from different backgrounds where English is not their first language. It currently supports all languages supported by google translate found [here].

It is currently being used by 34 streamers (including myself).

The source code is currently private but I am working on making it public.

Demo:
