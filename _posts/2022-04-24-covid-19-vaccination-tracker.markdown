This was a self-driven project as part of our [CSCC09] course (Programming on the Web) as a team of 3.

The motivation was to simplify the COVID-19 vaccination statistics for anyone to understand, even without being statisticically or mathematically oreinted. Due to the global nature, we implemented internationalization to broaden the target audience.
