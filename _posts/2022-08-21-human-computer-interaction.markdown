The project involved improving the UI/UX of the [Canada.ca] website, specifically on tax related tasks to ensure ease of use for fact-finding and accessibility.

This project was a component of [CSCC10] course (Human Computer Interaction), where we learned the basics UI/UX and conducting usability testing and experiments to improve the UI/UX of the platforms. The created and tested prototype, and the final research report are shown below.
