### Summary

- add summary sentence here

- Refactored, documented and tested over 100 Django RESTful APIs to improve speed performance by 70%.
- Integrated Google Maps library in 7 pages throughout the platform.
- Proposed a new QA testing method that has become a weekly standard procedure, leading to a faster uncovering of bugs and a more stable code base.
- Proposed and developed a documentation project to improve website documentation for the end client and to capture all code best practices for the development team.
- Won hackathon for adding a key feature that clients (hackathon judges) deemed necessary.
