# Personal Website

This is my personal website repository and the site itself can be found [here](mohamedtayeh.com).

The website is built using [Jykll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the source code is adapted from [Artem Sheludko](https://github.com/artemsheludko)'s [Adam Blog](https://github.com/artemsheludko/adam-blog) Jkyll theme.

Thanks for stopping by ðŸŽˆ
